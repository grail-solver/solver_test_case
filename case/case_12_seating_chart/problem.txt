You are trying to create a seating chart for a wedding reception. There are 100 guests and 25 tables, each of which can seat four people. You have a list of preferences from each guest about who they would like to sit with, and who they would prefer not to sit with. Your goal is to create a seating chart that satisfies all of these constraints, while also minimizing the number of guests who are unhappy with their assigned seat.
