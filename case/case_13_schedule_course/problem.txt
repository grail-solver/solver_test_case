You are trying to assign courses to professors at a university. There are 50 courses and 25 professors. Each professor has a list of courses they are willing to teach, but they can only teach one course per semester. Your goal is to assign each course to a professor that is willing to teach it, while also ensuring that each professor is assigned to a course they are qualified to teach.
