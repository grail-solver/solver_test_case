Problem: A school needs to schedule its classes for the upcoming semester. There are 5 classrooms and 8 classes that need to be scheduled. Each class must be assigned to a specific classroom, and each classroom can only hold one class at a time. Additionally, each class has a set of time slots during which it can be scheduled, and each classroom has its own set of available time slots. The goal is to create a schedule that assigns each class to a classroom and satisfies all of these constraints.
